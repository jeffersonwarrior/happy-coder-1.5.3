## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

### For Critical Security Issues:

- **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
- **Email**: security@happy.engineering (primary contact)
- **GitHub**: Contact [@jeffersonwarrior](https://github.com/jeffersonwarrior) directly via private message
- **Include**: Detailed reproduction steps, impact assessment, and affected versions

### For Non-Critical Issues:

- Create a GitHub issue with the `security` label
- Use the security issue template if available
- Provide clear description and reproduction steps

## Security Features

Happy Coder implements multiple layers of security:

### End-to-End Encryption

- **Algorithm**: TweetNaCl (same encryption as Signal)
- **Implementation**: All Claude Code conversations encrypted on-device
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Server cannot decrypt your data
- **Key Management**: Encryption keys never leave your devices

### Infrastructure Security

- **Automated Security Scanning**:
  - TruffleHog OSS for secret detection
  - GitLeaks for credential scanning
  - CodeQL for advanced code analysis
  - Custom pattern detection for API keys, tokens, and credentials
- **Dependency Security**:
  - Dependabot automated updates
  - npm audit scanning
  - Vulnerability monitoring
- **Code Quality**:
  - TypeScript strict mode
  - ESLint security rules
  - Automated testing

### Authentication & Authorization

- **QR Code Pairing**: Secure device-to-device authentication
- **Token Security**: GitHub tokens and API keys stored securely
- **Session Management**: Encrypted session state with automatic expiration

### Data Protection

- **Local Storage**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **Network Transit**: All communications over HTTPS/WSS
- **No Data Collection**: Zero telemetry, no tracking
- **Open Source**: Fully auditable codebase

## Response Timeline

| Severity Level                  | Response Time | Patch Timeline |
| ------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| **Critical** (RCE, Data Breach) | 24 hours      | 7 days         |
| **High** (Auth Bypass, XSS)     | 72 hours      | 14 days        |
| **Medium** (Info Disclosure)    | 1 week        | Next release   |
| **Low** (Minor Issues)          | 2 weeks       | Future release |

## Security Best Practices

### For Users:

- **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
- **Secure Tokens**: Store GitHub tokens securely, rotate regularly
- **Strong Authentication**: Enable 2FA on connected accounts
- **Network Security**: Use trusted networks for sensitive operations
- **Review Permissions**: Regularly audit connected services

### For Developers:

- **Secret Management**: Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` files for sensitive configuration
- **Dependency Security**: Keep dependencies updated, review security advisories
- **Code Review**: All security-related changes require review
- **Testing**: Write security tests for authentication and encryption features

## Security Architecture

### Threat Model

Happy Coder is designed to protect against:

- **Man-in-the-middle attacks**: End-to-end encryption
- **Server-side data breaches**: Zero-knowledge architecture
- **Credential theft**: Secure token storage and rotation
- **Code injection**: Input validation and sanitization
- **Supply chain attacks**: Dependency scanning and verification

### Trust Boundaries

- **Client-Side**: Trusted (your devices)
- **Happy Server**: Semi-trusted (encrypted data only)
- **Network**: Untrusted (encrypted in transit)
- **Dependencies**: Verified (automated security scanning)

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Assess impact and affected users
   - Implement containment measures
   - Notify security team within 4 hours

2. **Investigation**:
   - Conduct thorough analysis
   - Document attack vectors and impact
   - Prepare detailed timeline

3. **Resolution**:
   - Develop and test security patch
   - Coordinate disclosure with reporters
   - Release security update

4. **Post-Incident**:
   - Publish security advisory
   - Update security documentation
   - Implement preventive measures

## Compliance & Standards

Happy Coder follows security best practices including:

- **OWASP Mobile Security**: Mobile application security guidelines
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk management practices
- **Privacy by Design**: Built-in privacy protection
- **Secure Development**: SSDLC practices

## Dependencies Security

We continuously monitor and secure our dependency chain:

- **Automated Scanning**: GitHub Dependabot and npm audit
- **Regular Updates**: Security patches applied promptly
- **Vulnerability Database**: CVE monitoring for all dependencies
- **License Compliance**: Open source license verification

## Encryption Details

### Key Exchange

- **Algorithm**: Curve25519 (ECDH)
- **Implementation**: libsodium/TweetNaCl
- **Key Size**: 256-bit keys
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: New keys for each session

### Message Encryption

- **Algorithm**: XSalsa20 stream cipher
- **Authentication**: Poly1305 MAC
- **Nonce**: 192-bit random nonce per message
- **Integrity**: Authenticated encryption (AEAD)
