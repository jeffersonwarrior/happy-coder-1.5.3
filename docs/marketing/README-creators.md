# Happy Coder Content Creator Brief

## Key Features

Happy Coder is an open-source mobile app that lets developers control AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini-CLI) from their phone.

- Control Claude Code from iOS, Android, or web browser
- Runs on YOUR hardware (laptop, desktop, server, Raspberry Pi)
- No subscription fees or cloud costs - completely free (you still need to pay your AI model provider for Claude Code, Codex, Text to Speech, Speach to Text, etc..)
- Push notifications when agents need input or hit errors
- End-to-end encrypted connection between devices
- Run multiple coding agents in parallel
- Voice input for hands-free control
- Works with your existing dev setup and tools

## Key Value Props

- On Happy Coder, I can manage Claude Code from my phone without paying $600/year
- On Happy Coder, I never miss when Claude gets stuck on a permission prompt
- Happy Coder runs on my own computer, not expensive cloud servers
- On Happy Coder, I can check on long-running tasks without returning to my desk
- Happy Coder is open source - I can audit, modify, or self-host everything
- On Happy Coder, I can run multiple agents in parallel and switch between them instantly
- Happy Coder keeps my code on my machines with end-to-end encryption
- On Happy Coder, I can keep coding while commuting, eating, or away from my desk

## Example Hooks

- "I saved $600/year by switching from [competitor] to the open-source Happy Coder"
- "Claude asked for sudo permission... and I was at the gym"
- "That moment when your 2-hour refactor gets stuck 5 minutes after you leave"
- "Running 3 Claude Code agents in parallel from my phone while getting coffee"
- "Why pay $50/month for a middleman to relay text to Claude?"
- "I left for lunch and Claude was still working when I got back"
- "Managing my coding agents from the train saved me 2 hours today"
- "Finally, a mobile app for Claude Code that doesn't cost more than Netflix"
- "My code never leaves my laptop, but I can control it from anywhere"
- "Open source alternative to all those $600/year coding apps"

## Requirements for Content

- Emphasize running on YOUR hardware, not cloud servers
- Compare to paid alternatives ($50/month or $600/year competitors)
- Minimum video length: 15 seconds
- Use the GitHub star count as social proof when relevant

## Prohibited Content

- Don't claim AI does all the work (it doesn't)
